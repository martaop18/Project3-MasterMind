          <p>
            In <b>&ltmasterMind/&gt</b> the player must guess a secrete code by
            clicking the above colored buttons. The goal is to arrange different
            buttons in the correct order in a row. The resulting pattern must
            match the hidden code at the top of the board.
          </p>
          <p>
            It consists of 4 pins, which in turn can be selected from 4 colors.
            The player has up to 10 turns to crack the code for the beginner
            level, 8 turns and 5 colors for the Advanced level and six turns and
            six colors for the Expert level. A color can be represented several
            times.
          </p>
          <h3>clues</h3>
          <p>
            The narrow column next to the code preparation area serves as clue
            row. Clue buttons are either black or white.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A black clue means that there is a correct color in the correct
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            • A white clue means that a correct color is in the wrong place.
          </p>
          <p>• An empty clue slot means that a wrong color has been placed.</p>

              The order of the pins in the clue row does not refer to the
              position of the pins in the code row, it is completely random.
